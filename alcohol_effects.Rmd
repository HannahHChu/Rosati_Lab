# Protocol & Setup

## Cage 
1. Put together 12" x 12" meshed cages.
2. Supply with 4-5 sugar cubes and a 50mL Erlenmeyer flask filled with water and place a sponge to close the opening.

## Rearing
1. Please refer to [Adult Fly Room > Extraction](https://hannahhchu.github.io/2018-12-13_gen_insect_rearing.html#extraction) and [Dark Room > Making Jars](https://hannahhchu.github.io/2018-12-13_gen_insect_rearing.html#making-jars)
2. When larvae begin to pupate, place ~5 pupae into petri dishes and tape down the petry dish cap.
3. Check every 24 hours until fly emergence.
4. Place petri dishes with emerged flies into cages keeping track of how many [females and males](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26017826/50249572-65e0cb80-03ac-11e9-89da-29173014728d.png) are in each group -- (this experiment will use 50F, 25M)
5. Remove the additional male and female flies from the cage.
6. Allow 3-7 days for virgin flies to mate. 

## Experimental

1. Obtain the needed number of clear, plastic storage boxes
2. Insert a PVC tube (with air filter?) into the storage box.
3. Place cage with mated flies into the storage box.
4. Place test samples into cage and close the storage box lid. 
5. Observe oviposition behavior of female flies. Check every 15 minutes for 2 hours.
